Website Landing Page putting into practice html and css skills

This landing page put into practice the following skills that I have learned 
through the Odin Project up until now:

1) HTML
2) Git
3) Bash
4) VS Code
5) css
6) Flexbox
7) Other miscellaneous learned html and css tricks

The most important skills put to the test however were css and flexbox. My 
first objective was to create the landing page from scratch and make it similar
to the image of the end result provided by the Odin Project. 

Once the html,positioning, and styling were finished, I had to consider how the landing page
would look when the window would shrink. This led me to rework some of the approaches
of positioning that I had made for the various sections of the landing page.
For example, the css of section 1 of the content was reworked by setting up padding,
and set flex grow of 1 and flex basis of 0 so that the two subsections could take up 
equal space and properly wrap when the window would shrink. This allowed me to
better understand the flexbox mechanisms, and forced me to be detail oriented when
keeping in mind what would make for a better user experience.

The final step was to personalize the template that I had made. I decided
to make the landing page into a sort of travel website. I made my own logo, used
royalty free images, and styled the website to match the theme and match the colours.

Although I am not an expert, I feel much more comfortable now with css and positioning,
and am ready to move on to learning javascript.
